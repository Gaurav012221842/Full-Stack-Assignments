 What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML

 Ans:- The DOCTYPE declaration in HTML specifies the document type and version of HTML
  being used in the document. It is not an HTML tag; rather, it is an instruction to the web 
  browser about which version of HTML the page is written in. It helps the browser to render
   the webpage correctly.
